// 1. Control flow in try-catch OR try-catch-finally 
// 1.1 -> Exception occurs in try block and handled in catch block : If a statement in try block raised an exception, then the rest of the try block doesnâ€™t execute and control passes to the corresponding catch block. After executing the catch block, the control will be transferred to finally block(if present) and then the rest program will be executed.
