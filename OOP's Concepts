-> The main aim of OOP's is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
-> We can recognize a constructor because its declaration uses the same name as the class and it has no return type.
-> Simple Example to understand Abstraction:- Television remote control is an excellent example of abstraction. It simplifies the interaction with a TV by hiding the complexity behind simple buttons and symbols, making it easy without needing to understand the technical details of how the TV functions.
-> Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables. 
-> In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private, which means they can only be accessed within the class. To allow outside access to the instance variables, public methods called getters and setters are defined, which are used to retrieve and modify the values of the instance variables, respectively. By using getters and setters, the class can enforce its own data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent.
